The experiment ``Electronic Analog+Digital'' provides an introduction into modern data taking by reading out analog sensors and control devices with an ATmega328P micro-controller using the Arduino Uno platform. This manual will introduce you to the Arduino board and programming, the installation of the required software and the electrical components you will have to use. Basic knowledge on electronics, how to use oscilloscopes, bread boards and power supplies is recommended. \par
%
During the experiment you will learn how to build a circuit required for measuring the temperature with an NTC, including an operational amplifier. Furthermore you will control a fans speed via pulse width modulation and can build a regulator to keep the temperature of an object constant. Eventually you will use the Arduino to build a PID controller, which is a widely used technique.\par
%
In case you should already have previous knowledge we will provide additional components you can use in your experiment. Own ideas for other applications of the Arduino are very welcome and can be built after consulting the assistants.
