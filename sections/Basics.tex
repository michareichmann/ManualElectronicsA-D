%BEGIN Grove Base Shield
\subsection{Grove Base Shield}
The so called shields are printed circuit expansion boards, which plug into the normally supplied Arduino pin headers. The Grove Base Shield is one example that simplifies projects that require a lot of sensors or LEDs. With the Grove connectors on the base board, one can add all the Grove modules to the Arduino Uno very conveniently.\par

There are 16 Grove connectors on the Base Shield which are shown in \ar{tab:1}. Apart from the connectors the board also consists of a \ac{RST} button, a green LED to indicating power status, a toggle switch and four rows of pinouts, which is equivalent to the pinout of the Arduino.\par

		I2C				&	I2C											&	4	\\\tline{.5}

\end{table}

Every Grove connector has four wires, one of which is the \ac{VCC}. Since some micro-controller main boards need need different supply voltages the power toggle switch allows you to select the suitable voltage. In the case of the Arduino Uno a voltage of \SI{5}{\volt} is required \cite{grove:1}.
