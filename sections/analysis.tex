\section{Analysis / Protocol}

The analysis and the following protocol should be done such that the reader is able to reconstruct the described circuit and is able to proof that it is working correctly. That includes besides the exact description of all the used parts:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A link to the repository with all the used sketches. The code should be written in a readable fashion according to \href{https://gist.github.com/lefticus/10191322}{C++ coding guidelines} with meaningful denotations and sufficient comments.
	\item Circuit diagrams of \textcolor{red}{\textbf{ALL}} circuits. A circuit diagram consists of international standardised symbols for all parts in the circuit.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Besides you should answer all questions posed in \ar{sec:exp} describing the approach. Do not forget the results and a conclusion!
