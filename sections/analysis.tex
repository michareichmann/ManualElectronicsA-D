\section{Analysis \& Report}

The analysis and the following report should be done if a fashion, that the reader is able to reconstruct the described circuits and is able to proof that it is working correctly. Besides the exact description of all the used parts, this includes:
%
\begin{itemize}
  \item A link to the git repository with all the used sketches. The code should be written in a readable fashion according to \href{https://gist.github.com/lefticus/10191322}{\cpp coding guidelines} with meaningful denotations and sufficient comments.
  \item The circuit diagrams of \textcolor{red}{\textbf{ALL}} circuits. A circuit diagram consists of international standardised symbols for all parts in the circuit. You can, of course draw the diagrams manually, but there are also handy tools for that, like  \eg fritzing \cite{fritz}.
\end{itemize}
%
In addition, you should answer all questions posed in \ar{sec:exp} and describing the approach on solving them. Do not forget to add a results and a conclusion section!\par

If need help displaying code, or just like the style of this manual, have a look at the \TeX~source code \cite{man}.
